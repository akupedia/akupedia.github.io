I"P<p>#WHAT IS ETHICAL HACKING?
With the growth of the information security field in recent years has come dramatic growth in the field of ethical hacking, also known as white hat (good guy) hacking. Ethical hacking is the practice of attempting to infiltrate and exploit a system in order to find out its weaknesses and better secure it. I segment the field of ethical hacking into two primary components: penetration testing for a legitimate information security firm and working for your nationâ€™s military or intelligence agencies. Both are rapidly growing areas, and demand is strong.</p>
